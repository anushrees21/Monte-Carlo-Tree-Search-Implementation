# Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of a Single-Player Monte-Carlo Tree Search (SP-MCTS) algorithm, designed to optimize the Bin Packing Game. The project demonstrates how SP-MCTS can be used effectively in single-player games, where traditional methods like A* and IDA* may not perform well due to the lack of a suitable heuristic.
